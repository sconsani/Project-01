### About This Web App
https://github.com/sconsani/Project-01

“DOUGHNIT” is a web app made for users to explore various Donut Stores in the Bay Area, and “add” them to their Bucketlist of stores to check off as visited!

### User Stories

###### Site Page Load
* When a user visits doughnit.herokuapp.com, display these components:
    * Header
    * Navbar
    * Gallery of donut stores
    * Footer

###### Adding Donut Stores
*If the user is signed-in and clicks "Add to bucketlist" on a gallery store card:
    * Add the donut store to the user's bucketlist
    * Add the bucketlist to the donutstore's counter of times bucketlisted

###### 
* When a user clicks "Bucketlist" in the navbar:
* Load a new page with two columns: "*Username*'s Bucketlist:" and "Been there, DOUGHN that!"
* Display donut store cards the user has added to their bucketlist on the left side
* Add a button with a "x" label to the upper-righthand corner of the store card
* If the user clicks the "x" button, remove the donut store card from the user's bucketlist and remove the user's bucketlist from the donut store
* Change the "Add to Bucketlist" button to a "DOUGHNIT" button
* Display donut store cards the user has visited on the right side
* If the user clicks "DOUGHNIT", gray out and disable the button, add the donut store card to the right side column and change the button to "You've doughnit!" text
